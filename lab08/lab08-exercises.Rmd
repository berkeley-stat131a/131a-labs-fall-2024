# 🚘 💵 Lab 8: Used cars and cross-validation

<img src="img/cars.jpeg" alt="“cars”" width="500"/>\

**Due Date**: Friday, November 8th at midnight.

**Note:** HW4 includes material covered in this lab. HW4 is due Monday 11/4. So, aim to finish this lab by Friday 11/1.

Labs are submitted via Gradescope.

-   You will submit (1) a .Rmd file with your code, (2) a PDF of your code and output.
-   To generate a PDF of your code and output, **do not knit to PDF**. Instead, knit your .Rmd file as HTML, open the HTML file in a web browser, and then **print the HTML as a PDF, making sure that none of your code or output is cut off.** You can generate an HTML file in RStudio by pressing `Knit` and then `Knit to HTML`.
-   The knitting process will not work if there are errors in your code, so be sure to leave plenty of time to knit your lab notebooks before the deadline.

## ✅ Setup and data import

In this lab, we will explore underfitting, overfitting, and cross-validation with the same data from [Edmunds.com](https://edmunds.com) that we used in Lab 7.

-   **Previous goal from Lab 7:** Predict the price of a used car using its features (e.g., color).

-   **Goal of Lab 8:** Build a model that makes accurate predictions on data that was not used to train the model.

```{r}
# Load in additional functions
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# Use three digits past the decimal point
# Don't use scientific notation
options(digits = 3, scipen=999)

# Format plots with a white background and dark features.
theme_set(theme_bw())

cars = read_tsv("https://jdgrossman.com/assets/used-cars.tsv") %>% 
  # All cars in the dataset are of type "used"
  select(-type)

# peek at 10 random rows
sample_n(cars, 10)
```

## 🚀 Exercise 1

Using the `sample` function, randomly divide the cars dataset into two pieces called `cars_training` and `cars_validation`.

- `cars_training` should contain approximately 80\% of the dataset, while `cars_validation` should include 20\% of the dataset.

- Make sure that there is no overlap between the two datasets.

- Note that there are many different ways to split the data. You can ask PingPong to show you some different ways!

```{r}
# Your code here!

# This code makes your random split the same every time you run the code.
set.seed(131)

```

## 🚀 Exercise 2

Fit a linear model to the `cars_training` dataset that predicts `price` based on `year`.

- Store your model as `model_w_year`.

- Print the summary of your model.

- What is the interpretation of the `year` coefficient? 

```{r}
# Your code here!

```

## 🚀 Exercise 3

Using `mutate` and `as.character` to convert the `year` column in the `cars_training` to a string.

- Then, refit your model from Exercise 2, storing it as `model_w_str_year`.

- How does the $R^2$ of `model_w_str_year` compare to the $R^2$ of `model_w_year` in Exercise 2? Why?

```{r}
# Your code here!

```

## 🚀 Exercise 4

Compute the RMSE of `model_w_str_year` on the `cars_training` and `cars_validation` datasets.

- Recall that RMSE is the root mean squared error, where error is defined as the difference between the predicted price and the actual price.

- `predict(model, newdata = df)` will return the predicted outcomes for the data in dataframe `df`.

- Are there any differences in the two RMSE values? What is the reason for this difference? 

```{r}
# Your code here!


```

## 🚀 Exercise 5

Fit a new model to `cars_training` that predicts `price` based on `year`, `make`, and `mileage`.

- Store your model as `model_w_year_make_mileage`.

- Calculate the RMSE on the training data and the validation data. What do you notice?

- Is there evidence of overfitting? Explain.

```{r}
# Your code here!

```

## ⚔️ K-fold cross validation

In the last two exercises, we will estimate the out-of-sample RMSE of the `model_w_year_make_mileage` specification using cross-validation.

Recall that K-fold cross-validation has the following steps:

1. Split the data into K-folds of approximately the same size.

2. Iterate from 1 to K. At each iteration, hold out one fold, and train the model on the remaining folds. Then, validate on the held-out fold.

3. Average the results over the K iterations.

## 🚀 Exercise 6

Split the `cars` data into 5 folds of approximately equal size.

- One way to do this: First, randomly shuffle the data. Then, label the rows with a fold number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,...). You can use a new column for the fold number.

- `sample_frac(df, 1)` will randomly shuffle the rows of dataframe `df`.

- `rep(c(1,2,3), length.out = 8)` returns `c(1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2)`.

```{r}
# Your code here!

```

## 🚀 Exercise 7

Using a `for` loop, iterate from 1 to 5.

- At each iteration, hold out the fold with the corresponding fold number, and train the `model_w_year_make_mileage` specification on the remaining data.

- Keep track of each RMSE in an external vector called `rmses`.

- Finally, print the average of the RMSEs. 

- How does this **CV RMSE** compare to the RMSE of the simple validation set above?

- **Note:** Remember to convert the `year` column to a character as we did above.
